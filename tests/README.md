# Example & test scripts

- `test_mlp_classifier.py`

A test for `ml.nn.mlp_classifier` (`ml.classify.mlp_classifier` is an alias for this) using the MNIST handwritten digits dataset.
You can train a neural network with various methods for avoiding overfit, and easily reach accuracy rate of 98% for the test dataset.
See the comments in the script for the details.

- `test_classify.py'

- `test_cluster.py`

- `test_cluster2.py'

A simple example script, in which comparison is shown among 3 clustering algorithms: K-means, competitive learning, and the EM algorithm.
Animation that illustrates the process of clustering is available for K-means & EM.

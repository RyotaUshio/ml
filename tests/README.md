- `test_mlp_classifier.py`

A test for `ml.nn.mlp_classifier` (`ml.classify.mlp_classifier` is an alias for this) using the MNIST handwritten digits dataset.
You can train a neural network with various methods for avoiding overfit, and easily reach accuracy rate of 98% for the test dataset.
See the comments in the script for the details.
